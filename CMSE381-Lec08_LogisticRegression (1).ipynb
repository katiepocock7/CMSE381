    "This data set consists of percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index over 1,250 days, from the beginning of 2001 until the end of 2005. For each date, we have recorded the percentage returns for each of the five previous trading days, `Lag1` through `Lag5`. We have also recorded `Volume` (the number of shares traded on the previous day, in billions), `Today` (the percentage return on the date in question) and `Direction` (whether the market was `Up` or `Down` on this date). Our goal is to predict `Direction` (a qualitative response) using the other features."
